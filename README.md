Krishnagiri region is a part of the ancient Kongu Nadu and Chera country. 
Historically it was ruled by Chera rulers. Later the region came under Cholas,
 Pallavas, Gangas, Nulambas, Hoysalas, Vijaya Nagar and Bijapur emperors, Wodeyars 
 of Mysore and Nayaks of Madurai. This region of Krishnagiri served as "Gateway of 
 Tamil Nadu" and the protective barrier for the southern region defending onslaughts from
  invaders with motives of imperialism and exploitation. Krishnagiri Fort become the first
   and foremost defensive place. The majestic fortress, built on Krishnagiri hill by the Vijaya Nagar
    emperors, stands as testimony still now.

Krishnagiri is a district in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. 
The municipal town of Krishnagiri is the district headquarters. In Tamil Nadu, 
e-Governance was first introduced at Krishnagiri district under the National e-Governance
 Project (NEGP) in Revenue, Social Welfare departments on a pilot basis. The district is one 
 of the two largest producers of Mangoes not only in Tamil Nadu but throughout India.The Krishnagiri
  district has prehistoric importance. Archeological sources confirm the presence of habitats of man kind
   during Paleolithic, Neolithic and Mesolithic Ages. Various rock paintings and rock carvings of Indus Valley 
   civilization and Iron Age seen in this district support the historical significance of this district. 
   The heart of 'Krishnagiri', 'Hosur' and 'Uthangarai' were known as 'Eyil Nadu', 'Murasu Nadu' and 'Kowoor Nadu' 
   respectively. During Chola period, Krishnagiri region was called 'Nigarili Chola Mandlam' and 'Vidhugadhazhagi Nallur'. 
   Under 'Nulamba' rule it was popular as 'Nulambadi' according to historical sources.Hero stones were erected for those whose
    lost their lives in pursuit of adventure. There was a tradition of erecting memorial stones for people who sacrifice their 
    lives for the sake of their kings since 'Sangam Age'. These memorial stones were called 'Navagandam'. Plenty of memorial stones
     available in this district speak volumes about the valour and virtues of the people. Part of Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and
      Mysore were together named as "Thagadur Nadu" in Sangam Age. "Adhiayaman", the noble king offered 'Karunelli' (Goose Berry) to 
      the great poetess "Avvaiyar" who adorned his court for her long life. Krishnagiri was once ruled by Adhiyaman and hence also 
      known as 'Adhiayaman Nadu

The fort and its surroundings were commonly referred to as "Baramahal," 
a term that linguistically translates to "twelve palaces." This nomenclature reflects
 the presence of twelve hilltop forts in the region, including Krishnagiri Fort. This majestic 
 fort was constructed under the aegis of the Vijayanagara Empire.Later, this region was awarded 
 to Jagadevarayar by the Vijayanagar Empire in recognition of his exceptional valor in warfare.Under 
 his rule, the town of Jagadevi was established as his capital. However, with the decline of the Vijayanagar
  Empire, the fort and its environs fell briefly under the control of the Bijapur Sultanate.
In the 1670s, the formidable Maratha leader Shivaji I captured to Krishnagiri Fort during his 
Deccan expedition. Notably, the nearby MaharajaKadai Fort served as a trade post for the Marathas during this period.
