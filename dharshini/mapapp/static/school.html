All great Journeys began with a small step forward. Thus the trust started a
 co-educational matriculation school in 2004, with a vision to provide quality
  education that would enable a child to excel and face the global challenges with 
  confidence, without forgetting the social responsibilities. Krishnagiri welcomed
   this vision and perseverance with a royal salute and extended arms to help translate the vision into a mission.
