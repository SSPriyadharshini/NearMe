The fort and its surroundings were commonly referred to as "Baramahal," 
a term that linguistically translates to "twelve palaces." This nomenclature reflects
 the presence of twelve hilltop forts in the region, including Krishnagiri Fort. This majestic 
 fort was constructed under the aegis of the Vijayanagara Empire.Later, this region was awarded 
 to Jagadevarayar by the Vijayanagar Empire in recognition of his exceptional valor in warfare.Under 
 his rule, the town of Jagadevi was established as his capital. However, with the decline of the Vijayanagar
  Empire, the fort and its environs fell briefly under the control of the Bijapur Sultanate.
In the 1670s, the formidable Maratha leader Shivaji I captured to Krishnagiri Fort during his 
Deccan expedition. Notably, the nearby MaharajaKadai Fort served as a trade post for the Marathas during this period.
