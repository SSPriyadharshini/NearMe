 of the two largest producers of Mangoes not only in Tamil Nadu but throughout India.The Krishnagiri
  district has prehistoric importance. Archeological sources confirm the presence of habitats of man kind
   during Paleolithic, Neolithic and Mesolithic Ages. Various rock paintings and rock carvings of Indus Valley 
   civilization and Iron Age seen in this district support the historical significance of this district.

   respectively. During Chola period, Krishnagiri region was called 'Nigarili Chola Mandlam' and 'Vidhugadhazhagi Nallur'. 
   Under 'Nulamba' rule it was popular as 'Nulambadi' according to historical sources.Hero stones were erected for those whose
    lost their lives in pursuit of adventure. There was a tradition of erecting memorial stones for people who sacrifice their 
    lives for the sake of their kings since 'Sangam Age'. These memorial stones were called 'Navagandam'. Plenty of memorial stones
     available in this district speak volumes about the valour and virtues of the people. Part of Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and
      Mysore were together named as "Thagadur Nadu" in Sangam Age. "Adhiayaman", the noble king offered 'Karunelli' (Goose Berry) to 
      the great poetess "Avvaiyar" who adorned his court for her long life. Krishnagiri was once ruled by Adhiyaman and hence also 
      known as 'Adhiayaman Nadu
