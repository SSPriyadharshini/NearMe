Krishnagiri region is a part of the ancient Kongu Nadu and Chera country. 
Historically it was ruled by Chera rulers. Later the region came under Cholas,
 Pallavas, Gangas, Nulambas, Hoysalas, Vijaya Nagar and Bijapur emperors, Wodeyars 
 of Mysore and Nayaks of Madurai. This region of Krishnagiri served as "Gateway of 
 Tamil Nadu" and the protective barrier for the southern region defending onslaughts from
  invaders with motives of imperialism and exploitation. Krishnagiri Fort become the first
   and foremost defensive place. The majestic fortress, built on Krishnagiri hill by the Vijaya Nagar
    emperors, stands as testimony still now.
